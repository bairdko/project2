# Persona
###### Assigned: 9/26/18

**Collaborators:** [@bairdko](https://github.com/bairdko), [@jv1056](https://github.com/jv1056), and [@aseatts](https://github.com/aseatts)

### Overview

This app was the second project. The assignment was to create an app using NodeJS, Express, and Express Handlebars. The concept for this app is Digital Business Cards. You log in, create a Persona, and then a QR code is generated for you. By scanning the QR code, it will take you to a simple landing page with a couple links and a personal bio. You can create multiple personas, and have them be different types based on what setting they would be used for - personal, professional, dating, or custom.

- [@jv1056](https://github.com/jv1056): Users, login capabilites with PassportJS

### Potential Improvements:
- Needs a front-end. Design was never finished.
- An ability to edit or delete your created databases.
